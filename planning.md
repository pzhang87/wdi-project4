what should I work on first - does this even need a backend really?

figure out how to fetch stuff from the front-end

get a list of tournaments from vgbootcamp according to the name parameter

is it better to build the backend first or the frontend?

it's better to build the front-end right now

---

so - build the front-end which requests data from challonge

and ONLY save it to the back-end

---

so here's the data structure:

1. all (new) challonge and youtube requests should be made from the front-end for the first stage of the project
2. once you have confirmation you can get what you want, transfer over that data to the back-end and create a seed file

---

build a back-end. create some seed data. check.

---

abandon challonge API due to 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' issue. work solely from youtube videos.
